    "In this lab, you will train the YOLO! object detection algorihtm to detect an object of your choice. As Roboflow data sets are public, DO NOT train a model to detect Proxy cards or ID cards. You will train the model, rapidly analyize the performance of your model, and then apply your model to the webcam on your computer for real-time object detetion.\n",

    "The graded objectives for the lab are:\n",

    "(10 pts) Train the YOLO model to high accuracy for your domain\n",
    "\n",
    "  **\"What is high accuracy?\" ... It depends on your domain. If you want to make sure you recieve full credit, write down all of your efforts to improve the accuracy of the model, and write a statement why you think you have achieved peak accuracy in this model. Charts and graphs will help to justify your stance.\n",
